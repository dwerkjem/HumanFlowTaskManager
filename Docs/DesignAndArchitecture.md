# Design and Architecture

## Introduction

This document describes the design and architecture of the project. It is intended to provide a high-level overview of the project's structure and design principles.

## Design Principles

The HumanFlow Task Manager is designed with the following principles in mind:

- **Modularity**: The project is divided into separate modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application.
- **Extensibility**: The project is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for the addition of new features and functionality.
- **Interoperability**: The project is designed to work well with other systems and tools, allowing for easy integration with external services.
- **Principle of Least Astonishment (PoLA)**: The project is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, following common conventions and patterns.

## Architectural Overview

The architecture of the HumanFlow Task Manager follows a layered structure:

1. **Presentation Layer**: This layer handles the user interface and user experience. It is responsible for displaying information to the user and capturing user input.

2. **Application Layer**: This layer contains the business logic of the application. It acts as a bridge between the presentation layer and the data layer, ensuring that the core functionalities are executed correctly.

3. **Data Layer**: This layer manages data storage and retrieval. It interacts with databases, APIs, or other external services to store and fetch information as needed.

4. **Integration Layer**: This optional layer handles communication with external systems and services, such as third-party APIs or cloud services, ensuring smooth interoperability.

## Key Components

The End user interacts with 3 programs:

1. **Desktop Application**: The main interface for users to interact with the Task Manager. It provides a rich user experience and allows users to create, update, and track tasks.
2. **Web Application**: A web-based interface that provides access to the Task Manager from any device with a web browser. It allows users to access their tasks and manage them remotely.
3. **External Services**: Third-party services and APIs that the Task Manager integrates with, such as email services for notifications or cloud storage for data backup.

## Modules

- **Task Management Module**: Handles creation, updating, deletion, and tracking of tasks.
- **Notification Module**: Sends notifications and alerts to users based on task statuses or deadlines.
- **Planning Module**: Helps users plan and organize their tasks, providing tools for prioritization and scheduling.
- **Progress Tracking Module**: Monitors the progress of tasks and projects, providing insights into completion rates and bottlenecks.
- **Reporting Module**: Generates reports and analytics for performance tracking and monitoring.
